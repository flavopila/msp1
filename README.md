![responsive screen graphic](assets/readmefiles/screensizes.png)  


# Overview
 This is the repository for my fictional sushi bar and barbecue restaurant website project. It is my first milestone project (of 4 total) in my web development course. It will serve to showcase my ability to use HTML and CSS.  

 The goals of this project revolve around creating a responsive website with multiple sections and navigation links, with a focus on user experience design and implementation of both HTML and CSS to achieve a web-valid and also presentable design. I also opted to make use of technologies such as bootstrap to aid me in the structural design and other tools to aid in styling my pages, which I will list in the next part of this readme.

# Features 
### NavBar
<details><summary>Navbar Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/readmefiles/features-navbar.png" alt="Navbar" width="1500">
</details>

The bootstrap navbar I have implemented is designed to sit on top of every page, with lowered transparency to achieve a sleek and unobtrusive look. It will stick to the top even whilst you are scrolling so that navigation is always available. Using animate.css, the logo as well as the navigation links expand smoothly upon mouse hover, adding visual feedback for the user. Clicking the logo will take the user back to the homepage. Bootstrap has implemented collapsible navbar links into a hamburger menu for responsive design purposes and at smaller screen sizes it will activate.


### Footer
<details><summary>Footer Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/readmefiles/features-footer.png" alt="Footer" width="1500">
</details>

The footer that will appear at the bottom of every page. For consistency in visual communication, it will be consistent throughout all pages, except for the bright orange buttons. They will differ depending on the page you are currently on, this is explained further [here.](#streamlined-navigation) Through animate.css, I've added a smooth expanding effect to the buttons and social media icons, for visual feedback purposes.  The 3 sections of the footer are designed to stack on top of each other at smaller screen widths.


### Index
#### - Hero Section
<details><summary>Hero Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/readmefiles/features-index-1.png" alt="Homepage Section One" width="1000">
</details>

The hero section is as simple as it needs to be - it contains the full color version of the logo, the restaurant name, a subtitle explaining what kind of restaurant it is and a background panel containing a stock photo image of some sushi.  
The main thing to note is the little navigation arrow I have added towards the bottom of the section. It is an anchor link with an img element inside of it. I have included several of these on the homepage for smooth transitioning from section to section.

#### - Menu / Visit Section
<details><summary>Menu/Visit Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/readmefiles/features-index-2.png" alt="Homepage Section Two" width="1000">
</details>

The second section is designed around the most important things to the average visitor - it has two subsections, one for the menu category links and one revolving around getting the visitor into the restaurant, quickly showing them the opening hours, address, an iframe with google maps embedded and a button to book a table. The menu category links feature AI generated icons to give a visual aid to what the categories mean and help the visitor make a decision quicker. Clicking any of the category links will of course take the visitor to that portion of the menu.

#### - Photo Gallery Section
<details><summary>Gallery Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/readmefiles/features-index-3.png" alt="Homepage Section Three" width="1000">
</details>

The photo gallery section contains various images aligned in different orientations at different screen widths. As this section also serves to advertise vacancies at the restaurant, images of the staff at work are the largest. However, any image can be clicked and they will expand and be viewable at a higher resolution in a modal popup. I have added an animation that slightly expands the images when hovered over to hint at this functionality. At the smallest breakpoints, the gallery becomes a carousel, allowing mobile users to browse all the images available.

#### - Reviews Section
<details><summary>Reveiws Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/readmefiles/features-index-4.png" alt="Homepage Section Four" width="1000">
</details>

The last section of the homepage, with fictional aggregate scores on review sites and endorsements from fictional customers. At smaller screen widths some of the content is hidden. There is a link to the About page towards the bottom of this section.

### About
<details><summary>About Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/readmefiles/features-about.png" alt="about page" width="1000">
</details>

The about page is fairly straightforward. One div containing an image of the fictional headchef, his name, experience and a made up quote. Underneath that is another div with the company ethos and history, its overflow is set to scroll so that more information can be fit inside it without needing to make the page bigger.

### Menu 
<details><summary>Menu Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/readmefiles/features-menu.png" alt="menu page" width="1000">
</details>
<details><summary>Menu gif</summary>
<img src="assets/readmefiles/features-menu-function.gif" alt="menu page" width="1000">
</details>

The menu section is simple to understand for a visitor but it is one of the more complex subpages in this project. It has a [javascript](#javascript) function that allows for divs to be hidden and shown as the user clicks different menu categories. If the user has reached the menu page via one of the category links on the homepage, there will be a query string in the url and the menu page has a script that will listen for it. This results in the "Appetizers" category div being open when the page loads, if the user had clicked the "Appetizers" link on the homepage, and so on and so forth for the other categories.

### Bookings 
<details><summary>Bookings Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/readmefiles/features-bookings.png" alt="bookings page" width="1000">
</details>

The bookings page has a simple and easy to fill out form which requests the user's contact details and booking details such as guest amount and booking date/time. The user may also add additional requests at this stage. The form has several required fields and when they are filled out and the user clicks submit, it will redirect them to a thank you page (thankyou.html).

### Vacancies
<details><summary>Vacancies Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/readmefiles/features-vacancies.png" alt="vacancies page" width="1000">
</details>
<details><summary>Vacancies gif</summary>
<img src="assets/readmefiles/features-vacancies-function.gif" alt="vacancies page" width="1000">
</details>

The vacancies page has several divs outlining available vacancies that the user may apply for. Clicking apply on any of the vacancies will bring up a bootstrap modal with a varying title; the title will reflect the name of the vacancy that the user has clicked to apply for. The body of the modal will be a form that asks the user for their contact details and to upload their CV. They may also attach a cover letter if they desire. Clicking submit after filling in all required fields will redirect the user to a thank you page (thankyou.html). 

### Streamlined Navigation
I wanted the user experience to be as intuitive as possible, so I decided to implement navigation into the structure of my homepage,  
with each section linking to another page of the site with relevance to the section the user is currently viewing.  

For example the first section displays a menu section as well as location and opening hours, typically the first things a visitor would be looking for, streamlining their experience.  
The menu portion of this section includes links to different categories of the menu page and a link to the booking page.  
<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/readmefiles/section1.png" alt="Homepage Section One" width="1000"> 
</details>

If a visitor were to follow the menu links, the menu page also has a link to make a booking after they have explored the menu.  
Conversely, the bookings page also has a link to the menu. This is all possible through the bootstrap navbar at the top of the page, but I believe navigation routes within the content of the page allow for a more intuitive experience. 
<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>
<img src="assets/readmefiles/menubookingbutton.png" alt="Booking Button Link" height="400">  <img src="assets/readmefiles/bookingmenubutton.png" alt="Menu Button Link" height="400">  
</details>

I have also designed these pages to be visually similar to each other, but distinct to the homepage. This reinforces the idea that the user is on a subpage, and strengthens the relationship between the pages to encourage an intuitive understanding of the website's navigation tree. I have adhered to the overall house style but I have created a separate background for all subpages as can be observed above. 


# Design 
### Colour Scheme
I used a color scheme that mainly used neutral tones such as greys, white and black but had splashes of vibrancy come through in light and dark oranges, <span style="color: #FC0">#FFCC00</span> being the main colour for the house style and the darker <span style="color: #F60">#FF6600</span> complimenting it from time to time, for example as a gradient on buttons and as the trim for some images. I settled on these two particular colours as I was creating the full logo graphic for the restaurant, as I felt the beer portion of the logo was something I wanted to highlight, signalling to the viewer one of the restaurant's specialties of craft beer from Hokkaido. I felt the colours were evocative of a flavourful brew. I then decided to unify the design of the website by reusing those colour values for other areas of the website.
<img src="assets/readmefiles/palette.png" alt="Webpage Palette" height="400">  

### Fonts
Making use of [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), I picked out the fonts Playwrite NG Modern and Comfortaa. Playwrite NG Modern was the font I used for the restaurant name as part of the logo, as I felt it had a nice balance of luxury and simplicity. It's a cursive font that implies a higher quality restaurant experience but readability is high due to the font's design stemming from ESL (English Second Language) learners in schools worldwide. As for Comfortaa, I felt that it was similar to Playwrite NG Modern in it's clean and readable appearance, but was much less fancy, and it would be useful for conveying information to a clearer degree, while still appearing consistent with the house style.

### Skeleton
I was able to use a trial version of [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/#) to design a wireframe for the homepage. Unfortunately due to time constraints, I decided to start working on the project before creating responsive design versions of the page, as well as wireframes for other pages I would be creating. However, I found that the homepage wireframe served as an adequate reference point for subsequent page designs and I was able to reuse code from my homepage to create a template for the rest of the website.

Here is the initial wireframe design I came up with for the entire scroll of the homepage:

#### <details><summary>display/hide wireframe design</summary><img src="assets/readmefiles/skeleton.png"></details>  

For the most part the homepage I have created follows this design, with only a few page elements changed. For example, the carousel I had planned for the gallery section is now only set to display at smaller screen sizes, and all images are displayed together at larger sizes. I felt that this worked better as I did not have a large amount of images to add. Despite not managing to create wireframes for different responsive screen sizes, I was still able to use this design to inform my decisions in that area of the project.
